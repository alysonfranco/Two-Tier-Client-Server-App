# A Two-Tier Client-Server Application Using MySQL and JDBC

This project involves developing a two-tier Java-based client-server application that interacts with a MySQL database using JDBC. The application includes a GUI front-end for clients to execute SQL commands and a specialized interface for monitoring transactions.

## Key Features
- **Java GUI Front-End:** Allows clients to execute SQL DDL and DML commands.
- **User Authentication:** Verifies user credentials via properties files.
- **Transaction Logging:** Logs user operations in a separate database.
- **Specialized Accountant Interface:** Restricted to querying the transaction logging database.
